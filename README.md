**My motivational Quotes** : ✍️

<i>“Somebody told me I’m a failure, I’ll prove them wrong.”
<br>
“Failing doesn’t give you a reason to give up, as long as you believe.”
<br>
“Power is not will, it is the phenomenon of physically making things happen.”
<br>
“When people are protecting something truly special to them, they truly can become as strong as they can be.”
<br>
<br>
“It is only through the eyes of others that our lives have any meaning.”
<br>
  “Even the strongest of opponents always has a weakness.”
<br>
  “Once you question your own belief it’s over.”
<br>
  “Only one thing can heal the heart, and that’s love.”
<br>
  “Those Who Do Not Understand True Pain Can Never Understand True Peace.”<i>
